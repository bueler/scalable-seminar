title: Scalable Seminar
---

This is the draft page of **Math 692 Graduate Seminar** in Spring 2023, in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

## seminar organizer

[Ed Bueler](http://bueler.github.io/).  Email me at [elbueler@alaska.edu](mailto:elbueler@alaska.edu).

### official details

Time and place: to be determined

CRN: to be determined

Credits: 1.0, but **non-credit attendance is also strongly encouraged**.  If you want to take the seminar for credit then you should expect to give a least one presentation.

## proposed content

My idea is to have a seminar where we can learn about mathematical (or somewhat mathematical) algorithms which are aimed at solving large problems.  The best algorithms are *optimal* because they solve in $O(n)$ or $O(n\log n)$ time or memory, for data size $n$.  While optimal performance is not possible for some problems, algorithms which scale well with $n$ have a chance of solving the biggest, hardest problems in areas where mathematics is applied.

The ideal presentation might explain, and show concretely with examples, how an optimal (or near-optimal, or best-known) discrete or continuous algorithm works.  Each presentation should at least to try to clarify the size $n$ of the data to which the algorithm applies.  Presenters should explain how the run time, amount of computation, or amount of memory of the algorithm depends on the size $n$ of the data.

Beyond such basic expectations the talks should be diverse and the topics very wide-ranging!  See some possible topics below; there must be many more I don't know about.

Big O notation will often be used in presentations here, but the goal is *not* to create a theory of complexity course.  See [CS 611 Complexity of Algorithms](https://catalog.uaf.edu/courses/cs/) for that.

### possible topics

  * iterative linear algebra for sparse matrices
  * fast Fourier transform (FFT)
  * fast sorting algorithms
  * multigrid for solving partial differential equations
  * fast multipole methods for interacting particle systems
  * sparsity-exploiting direct solvers in linear algebra
  * fast integer multiplication, convolutions, etc.
  * spectral methods for differential equations
  * limited-memory optimization schemes
  * geometric algorithms in computer graphics (e.g. [here](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall04/cos226/lectures/geometry.4up.pdf))
  * graph algorithms (?)
  * monte carlo algorithms (?)
