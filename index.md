This is the draft page of **Math 692 Graduate Seminar** in Spring 2023, in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

## sketch of the content

My idea is to have a seminar where we can learn about any mathematical algorithms, or even algorithms more generally, which are aimed at solving large problems.  Each presentation would be expected to try to clarify the size $n$ of the data to which the algorithm applies, and try to understand or estimate how the time, amount of computation, or amount of memory depends on the size $n$ of the data.  Beyond that basic expecation the topics could be very wide-ranging.

Big O notation might often be used, but the goal is not to have a course on the theory of complexity.  (See [CS 611 Complexity of Algorithms](https://catalog.uaf.edu/courses/cs/) for that.)  Instead the goal is to concretely understand applications of mathematics, discrete or continuous, by looking at algorithms that have a chance of solving big problems in the real world.

### possible topics

  * fast Fourier transform (FFT)
  * fast sorting algorithms
  * iterative linear algebra for sparse matrices
  * multigrid for solving partial differential equations
  * sparsity-exploiting direct solvers in linear algebra
  * fast integer multiplication, convolutions, etc.
  * spectral methods for differential equations
  * fast multipole methods for interacting particle systems
  * limited-memory optimization schemes
  * graph algorithms (?)
  * fast monte carlo implementations (?)
  * geometric algorithms in computer graphics (?)
